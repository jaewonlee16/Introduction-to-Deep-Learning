It leads to understanding the latent vector of the VAE is more interpretable than the AE latent vector. Due to insufficient training, the latent vector of the AE and VAE might be quite far from the wanted distribution.. However, you can see the difference between the latent vector of the VAE and AE."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":890},"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-01T17:21:43.499658Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-01T17:21:43.499467Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-01T17:21:44.068345Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-01T17:21:44.067759Z"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2077,"status":"ok","timestamp":1701530756562,"user":{"displayName":"배현웅","userId":"14643794117352663059"},"user_tz":-540},"id":"Msjb6RLUnCE2","outputId":"d789d588-0d2c-4ee8-d109-5354f08942dc"},"outputs":[],"source":["import cv2\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","output = cv2.imread(\"./test_file/VAE_AE_output.png\")\n","plt.axis('off')\n","plt.imshow(output)\n","plt.pause(0.01)\n","output = cv2.imread(\"./test_file/VAE_AE_output_1.png\")\n","plt.axis('off')\n","plt.imshow(output)\n","plt.pause(0.01)\n","output = cv2.imread(\"./test_file/VAE_AE_output_2.png\")\n","plt.axis('off')\n","plt.imshow(output)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"iHX8RPE_nCE2"},"source":["### Let's compare the latent vector of the VAE and AE!"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-01T17:21:44.070893Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-01T17:21:44.070589Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-01T17:23:13.831520Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-01T17:23:13.830883Z"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":409764,"status":"ok","timestamp":1701534201269,"user":{"displayName":"배현웅","userId":"14643794117352663059"},"user_tz":-540},"id":"HgKusrbFnCE2","outputId":"0fe49e82-4c3c-40dd-c367-7aeb2aed087c"},"outputs":[],"source":["plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))\n","visualize_latent_dim(trained_encoder_VAE, title='VAE',position='left')\n","visualize_latent_dim(trained_encoder_AE, title='AE',position='right')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SAChw292FYhk"},"source":["## The generated image of the VAE depending on the latent vector dimension\n","From now, the latent vector of the VAE is 2-dimensional.
